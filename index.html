                            Hello, I am a 20 year old Student
                    <br>    who is currently finishing a Software Engineer course.
                    <br>    I am an Ice Hockey coach, level 1, 
                    <br>    and in 2022 I will be tested for my level 2 certification.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <!-- Teaching and coaching -->

                            I have a lot of experience in teaching,
                    <br>    I have taught kids and teens since 2017 how to yoyo, 
                    <br>    and for the last 3 years have coached people how to skate and play Ice Hockey
                    <br>    which has allowed me to gain a lot of patience and understanding of people and their capabilities.
                    <br>    Everyone is different and we all learn in different techniques. Teaching and coaching,
                    <br>    has allowed me to learn new ways of sharing my knowledge to others and to educate.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <!-- Future dream and motivation -->

                            My dream job would be to be an Archaeologist,
                    <br>    I love history and have always focused on historical events whenever a topic occurs.
                    <br>    I also love the the english language, and it's history. 
                    <br>    I am aiming to be a history teacher in the next 5 years,
